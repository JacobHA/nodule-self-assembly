# TODO:
*Need to try profiling and find possible speedups*
Modelling:
- "Repellent" mechanism / genotypes
- Cells that inherit repellent / attractive genes (cancer cells "want" to spread i.e. invade)

Calculations:
- Do subgridding / more efficient collision detection

Visualization:
- Make axis log scale on histogram
- Remove axes on gif?
