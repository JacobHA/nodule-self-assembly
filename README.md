# nodule-self-assembly
 Modelling the self-assembly seen in cancer cell populations
 
 Built with Python
 
 ## TODO
 - Check for collisions across the boundary (we have periodic BCs)
 - Speed up plotting (there seems to be a memory leak with matplotlib multiple figures)
 - Allow cells to grow
 
 ## Dependencies
 Numpy
 Matplotlib
